So you have your next big business idea. 

Aren't you also tired of working on it for several weeks just to realize that nobody wants what you have to offer?

This is the most common reason why startups fail. They’ve built something nobody wants. 

Many aspiring entrepreneurs think they have to offer something nobody has done before. But this is not true, actually. If nobody has thought of what you have thought of, there is a high chance that nobody needs it. 

Competition is a good sign. It means there is an actual demand for the solution you want to offer. 

But how do you find customers if 15 other businesses are doing what you want to do? 

To explain this, let’s do some time-traveling.

Back in the day before the internet, it was not necessary to look for highly innovative ideas. The markets were constrained by their location. There could be an accountant in New York and another account in Los Angeles, and their potential customers would never overlap. A business in Los Angeles would never know about an accountant in New York. 

The internet enabled location-independent markets and business. Suddenly, an account from Los Angeles can serve customers in New York and vice versa. 

Location is no longer a factor that shields you from competition. 

But that doesn’t mean that you have to do something esoteric to be successful. Instead, you have to stand out. And you can stand out by being very specific about your customers and tailor-fitting your business to these customers.

In the pre-internet era, an accountant in rural Idaho had to serve everybody. He had to work with whatever business wanted to work with him because the local market for accounting services was just not big enough to be picky about your customers.

But with the internet, the story changed. 

The accountant from rural Idaho isn’t bound to his local market anymore. He can take on customers from anywhere (theoretically at least). This now enables him to be picky about his clients. He can decide to only work with dog hairdressers or chiropractors. 

Was this possible before? No. The market of dog hairdressers in rural Idaho wasn’t big enough. But the market of all dog hairdressers in the US might be big enough for one accountant to thrive.

There will always be big corporations offering services similar to yours (like accounting), but they can't tailor-fit their business to the specific needs of certain groups of customers, especially if these groups are small in their eyes (small is relative here).

But you as an indie entrepreneur can fit your offerings to a small group of people and still live from it. 

This is your secret sauce. 

You can make sure that the group of people you serve are delighted with what you offer because you understand them, their business and what they need from you. 

This will be your competitive advantage in a crowded market. You understand your customers better than anyone else. 

So lean into it. 

Offer stuff for very specific business with very specific needs. There are groups of businesses who are not happy with their current accountant, their invoice software or their web design agency. 

Go on and offer your help to these people and show them you understand better than anyone else.
